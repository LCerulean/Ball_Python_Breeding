# Ball_Python_Breeding

This was a project I completed for the Databases course on Codecademy.  I chose ball python breeding for my topic due to the fact I already had several years of data from small business I ran.  I thankfully kept very good records, already in tables in Google Sheets and I wanted to see how it translated into SQL.

I narrowed the focus of my database down to just the information needed for choosing pairings and recording the outcome, as that would provide me with the data needed to best choose future pairings, and identify both my best and worst breeders.

## Project Objectives
Here is a summary of the project objectives:

-Research the topic of your choosing to create a entity relationship diagram for your database
<br>-Create the schema of the database using PostgreSQL
<br>-Populate your database with some data
<br>-Update your database to ensure your data stays intact. This could include adding constraints and roles
<br>-Update your database to ensure your database stays fast. This could include adding indexes, normalizing your database, and actively monitoring and maintaining your database.
